I am Lexy Dennis, a current Junior at UHM.  Up until this semester I have mostly applied myself toward developing my soft skills, and although I thoroughly enjoy interacting with people, something felt amiss.  I wanted the satisfaction of producing and developing tangible projects in my life.  

As far as my two eyes can see, technology is the future.  I want to be able to keep up with our tech-based society not only as a businesswoman but as a consumer.  Paired with my penchant for solving puzzles and understanding how things work, MIS seemed like a good option as a third major.
