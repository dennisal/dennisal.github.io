The latest WOD was the Invoice2 WOD.  This WOD had us create an invoice table using dynamic elements, such as the names, quantities, and prices of the listed items.  It was definitely a lot less time consuming to complete than the BrowserHistory WODs.  Sometimes the hardest part about performing these is simply understanding the directions.  I tend to overthink what I need to do, and end up spending unnecessary time on a task.  Therefore, on this WOD I started the screencast whenever I was dumbstruck by a task so that I could hear the question explained orally.  I would then pause the video and do the task on my own, granted it became clarified.  This method allowed me to stay on track in a timely manner, and I ended up getting nearly the same code as in the screencast.  Afterward I would run my attempted code, then unpause the screencast to watch up to the point I just completed.  If it was performed a different way then I would try out the new method and this would give me more practice as I would work alongside the instructor, gaining a better understanding of the task as it is explained in the process.  This helped me to understand the code much better.  

In past WODs I did not look at the screencast unless I absolutely needed to, but this time being able to work alongside the instructor, or at least watch up to the point I was confused on, turned out to be very helpful in my learning and comprehension.

For the next WOD I plan to use a similar method where I try out the WOD up until a point (if any) I am stuck on, and then watch the beginning of the screencast to clear up the task.  I will then try it on my own again, run it, and then watch the screencast for confirmation.  I will continue to keep up with the readings and pay attention in class as well because that has helped tremendously so far.
