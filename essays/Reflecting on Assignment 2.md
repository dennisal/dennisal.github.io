1. What did you learn from this assignment?

   I learned how to stare at a computer screen for HOURS on end.  HA.  But seriously, I spent a lot of time on this assignment.  I learned how to add form data to a query string, which was helpful in connecting the data on my index.html page to the invoice page (through the login or registration page).  I also learned more patience as most of the mistakes are simple, but painstakingly not clear to see.
   
2. Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).

  I did not work with a partner.  100% contribution :)
3. How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?
I relentlessly and shamelessly utilized Dr. Port’s office hours.  I needed help figuring out how to do a fetch to the server so that I could validate my login and registration page on the server then show the error messages in the browser.

4. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?

  Assignment 1 was more difficult for me to develop just because I used a CSS template and I had to do a LOT of additional research and snooping on the console to figure out what I could do to make my page appear how I wanted it to.  It took a lot of time.  Assignment 2 similarly took a lot of time, but in a different way.  This time I was more focused on how to get the response from the validation functions on the server to appear in the browser.  This was my pill to swallow this time around, and it was still difficult and time consuming, but in a different way—I felt more confident navigating my way around Assignment 2 than I did in Assignment 1 (probably because I prepared myself with all the Googling I had to do from the first one). 

5. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging

    A: 20% of the time.

    B: 10% of the time.

    C: 10000000000% (but realistically more like 70% of the time).

6. Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?

  Writing the query string worked well and was probably the easiest part for me.  What did not work well was fetching the response from the functions on the server to display in the browser.  I had originally intended to merely display the error messages in the browser and then have the server redirect to the next page, but since I was never able to figure out how to do that, I settled for redirecting to the next page on the client-side.  We all have to make adjustments eventually, right?

7. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?

  I would try to make the page redirect on the server-side rather than the client-side.  Other than that, I am happy with how my Assignment 2 turned out.
