0) What did you learn from this assignment?

    I learned to use cookies and sessions (very nice to use, but pretty hard for me to wrap my head around at first).

1) Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).

    Me: 100% because I worked alone.

2) Briefly explain your rationale for the above percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partner contributed (e.g. â€œI worked on the security and my partner worked on making the user data consistent...")  

    I worked by myself.

3) How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1? 

    I was more intent on having to get the data to be transferred between multiple pages whereas in Assignment 1 I was more concerned with developing the CSS and general UI.

4) Describe what worked well with this project? 

    I think that my UI is pretty nice, and it worked really well using sessions to autofill data from other pages!

5) If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change? 

    I would have asked more questions earlier on.  The assignment seemed too huge and daunting so I didn't try to ask as many questions because it was overwhelming, but I wish I would've.  I would change my sessions from the client-side to the server-side.
